<h2>🎯 Problem Statement<h2>
Many college students receive daily or weekly allowances but struggle to manage their money responsibly. Without proper tracking tools:
<ul>
  <li>Small expenses add up unnotices</li>
  <li>Savings goals are inconsistent</li>
  <li>No visibility into spending patterns</li>
